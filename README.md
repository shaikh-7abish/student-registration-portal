# student-registration-portal
I created this registration portal for students with HTML, CSS, PHP. 
Also I used bootstrap for CSS.
In this portal user can enter data and view all data in different styles such as view all data or view single data by using studnet unique id.
Also make sure to run the configuration file to create database and table for better use of the portal -- location of configuration file is 
"config/configuration.php"
